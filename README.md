# Eatstagram

A mobile app based , in-house restaurant management system built with [Flutter.](https://flutter.dev/) 

Eatstagram has a separate [restaurant app](https://github.com/KnightproEx/eatstagram-restaurant) to provide access to administrative actions such as creating menus and updating orders. Together , they form a complete solution to digitalise an entire restaurant's workflow.  

## Features 
### Scan restaurant QR codes

All restaurants are given a unique QR code , which can be scanned to reveal an interactive and easy to use digital menu of the restaurant.

### Select and place orders

Placing an order is as easy as it looks. It takes only about 2 minutes for you to place an order , and most importantly make sure its never forgotten through the system.

### Display order status

We hate second guessing too ! Customers will no longer be left wondering and instead be able to view how their orders are progressing in real-time.
